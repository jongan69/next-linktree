# Next.js LinkTree Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This project is a customizable LinkTree-like application built with Next.js. It allows users to create a personal page with links to various social media profiles and referral links, all styled and organized in a visually appealing manner. The design is responsive and includes an interactive 3D background for a modern, dynamic user experience.

## Features

- **Personal Links**: Easily add and manage links to your social media profiles (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.).
- **Referral Links**: A dedicated section to display your referral links, complete with a customizable header for branding or messaging.
- **3D Background**: The page features a visually engaging 3D background powered by `@react-three/fiber`.
- **Styled Components**: Custom styling is done using `styled-components`, enabling flexible and reusable components.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile views to ensure a smooth experience on all devices.
- **SEO-Friendly**: Pre-rendering and SEO enhancements come built-in with Next.js, improving the page’s discoverability.
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Toggle between dark and light modes for better accessibility and user preferences.
